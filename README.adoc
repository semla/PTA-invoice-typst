# PTA Typst Invoice

Invoice for use with PTA software like hledger and https://tackler.fi/[Tackler].

## Background
When trying out plain text accounting (PTA), I needed a way to create pdf invoices. I stumbled on Typst and here is the result.

For PTA I use hledger which is really easy to use. I am considering Tackler due to its journal data auditing features, which allows it to cryptographically prove the data has not changed. For now the Tackler features may not be quite up to date.

The address placement *hopefully* fits a C5 envelope with an h2 "window". So far I haven't had to print the invoice so it is not tested.

## Data
.The invoice reads from .toml and .json / csv files:
* clients.toml
* static_data.toml
* 2 json / csv files containing the balance and register, the path and file names and are specified in static_data.toml. If the file is a csv it is inferred it is exported from Hledger with a similar command to the one below. If json, Tackler.
* VAT: with Tackler the accounts in the exported register can be used. With Hledger you can set the hledger_account_name_for_vat which adds the hledger_vat_text. 

### CSV from Hledger
Generate the csv with something like: +
`hledger register -f .hledger.example.journal --invert date:2025-03-03 layout wide desc:x revenue liabilities:vat:sales-25 -O csv > exported-from-pta/register-exp-hledger.csv`

`hledger balance -f .hledger.example.journal date:2025-03-03 layout wide desc:x assets:receivable -O csv > exported-from-pta/balance-exp-hledger.csv`

### JSON from Tackler
Generate the json with something like: +
`tackler --config journal/conf/tackler.toml  --output.dir . --output.prefix report`

### PDF
Create pdf with: +
`typst compile invoice-01.typ`
